# Rails Reserved Words

This project is an attempt to document all the reserved words for Rails in a clear and concise manner. It's nowhere near done yet, but with your help it could get a couple of steps closer!

## Adding new pages

To add a new page, create a new file in the `src` directory, following the examples of the files that are already there. Once you're done, verify your change by running `rake build` and then running a simple web server to view the changes:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 

If you don't have Python installed, find another way to run a local server.

Once your changes are verified, please submit a PR to this project.

## OMG A BUG!

Before you go filing an issue, I'd recommend investigating this bug yourself. The source behind this is really simple, and you're probably smarter than you think. Give it a shot!

If you still can't figure it out, then go ahead and submit an issue about it.
